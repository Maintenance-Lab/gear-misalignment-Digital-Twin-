# gear-misalignment-Digital-Twin-
Code and models for the gear misalignment Digital Twin  
The system is controlled by a pi4 4gb connected to a Odrive motor driver. 
The main script is used to collect data, run the ai and write a .csv.
The other script provided are to control the motors. 
There is also an import folder for the W&B for the ai.

# calobrating the motors 
The motors are calibrated by hand, the values found are in the calibration_motor.py scripts if there is a problem with the calibration of the motors (motors exit its control mode or jittering) run the calibration scripts. If this doesn't work follow Odrives instructions on calibrating the motors ( https://docs.odriverobotics.com/v/0.5.4/control.html )

# training of the ai
the ai's are train using Fast.ai and TSAI the first script to train and the loop used for the research.
